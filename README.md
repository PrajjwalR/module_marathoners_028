# MeetSync

MeetSync is a web-based scheduling application that simplifies meeting bookings and appointments. Similar to Calendly, it allows users to share their availability and let others book time slots based on their schedule. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, and Firebase is used for the backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
- **Custom Availability**: Users can set their availability, specifying the dates and time slots they are open for meetings.
- **Booking System**: Visitors can select a time slot from the user's available times and book an appointment.
- **Notifications**: Email notifications are sent to both parties once a meeting is booked.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is fully responsive and works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
